# PREDICTION OF HYPOTENSION FROM IHEALTH BPMETER
INTEGRATED WITH BLOCKCHAIN

<h2>Process Flow</h2>
1.Systolic and diastolic pressure values are fetched from IHealth BPmeter. [Python]<br>
2.Gorti's Homomorphic Encryption is applied and Mean Arterial Pressure[MAP] is calculated. If MAP>50g/dL, then patient is at the risk of Hypotension. [Java]<br>
3.Results are sent from edge to cloud server. [Java to Javascript]<br>
4.Ganache is deployed on cloud, and data is stored on Blockchain using DApps and User interface is created. [Truffle, Solidity]<br>
5.If researcher, encrypted data of all patients is displayed. If patient, one's own decrypted test report is displayed.[ReactJs, Web3.js]<br>
